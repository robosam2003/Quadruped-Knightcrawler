# Quadruped-Knightcrawler - A project from a simpler time... 
### September 2019 - May 2020

This was a really fun one, A four legged robot that took on many forms, including the "Knightcrawler" from Batman (below, left), eventually becoming a robot dog.

The robot used high-torque hobby servo motors and a 16-channel servo driver over I2c, controlled by the raspberry pi. 

It could be controlled using a third-party ps3 controller, and included forward, backward, traverse left, traverse right, spin left, spin right, "lie down" and "sit" functions:
